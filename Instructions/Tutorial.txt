We are still developing the sample code for this functions 
you can follow the video to use the program 
tested in win10x64 
---------------------------------------------------
Functions 
1.- Matching using the ROI in the image
2.- From the matching ROI insert the circle to measure 
	It's posible to define the radius I wan to find 
3.- Once the ROI for matching and measure circle are defined 
     we measure and match the pattern.
	 We can save and use later this pattern
4.- In order to detect the line First we need to use Image processing
	- We use a threshold to change the picture until we can 
	apply the line we need to find
5.- We apply line ROI and to the picture 
6.- Set parameters and measure the line 
7.- The line return some values like point A and B and
	the line equation .
8.- Since we have the Cx AND Cy (center from circle step 3)
    we can calculate the vector from the center to the middle point of the line 
	detected. (this step has not been done yet)
	---------------------------------------
An example how to get and plot the data from the line and circle can be found in the 
button "Find Shortest" 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We are still in progress in some functions  therefore this will be improve.
